# Momiji's Blog

A personal, content-driven blog built with **Next.js App Router**, focused on long-form writing, reflective essays, and technical notes.

This project treats both **code and content as first-class citizens**, emphasizing clarity, maintainability, and long-term evolution rather than short-term metrics.

## 📝 Writing Posts

Blog posts are stored in `content/posts` as `.mdx` files.

Each post includes front matter such as:

```yaml
title: My First Post
description: A short summary shown in preview cards
createdAt: 2026-02-01
```

Content changes are tracked with Git, making the writing process transparent and reversible.

---

## 🧭 Versioning Philosophy

* **Code changes** follow semantic versioning when appropriate.
* **Content changes** are committed independently and treated as part of the project history.
* Git is used as a **time axis** for both technical evolution and thought development.

---

## 📌 Roadmap

* [ ] Improve content navigation
* [ ] Add RSS feed
